Sure, here are the details about the entities, objects, and other concepts that are needed for the application in terms
of DDD:

 * Subscription - A subscription is an aggregate root that represents a user's subscription to the service. Subscriptions
have a unique identifier and a status. The unique identifier is a UUID that is generated when the subscription is
created. The status can be either "subscribed" or "unsubscribed".

 * User - A user is an object that represents a user of the service. Users have a name, email address, and password. The
name is a string that represents the user's name. The email address is a string that represents the user's email
address. The password is a string that represents the user's password.

* Rate - A rate is a value object that represents the current exchange rate of BTC to UAH. The rate is a floating-point
number that represents the number of UAH that can be exchanged for 1 BTC.

* SubscriptionRepository - A repository that provides access to the collection of subscriptions. The
SubscriptionRepository is responsible for storing, retrieving, and updating subscriptions.

* UserRepository - A repository that provides access to the collection of users. The UserRepository is responsible for
storing, retrieving, and updating users.

* GetRateUseCase - A use case that gets the current exchange rate from a third-party service. The GetRateUseCase is
responsible for getting the current exchange rate from a third-party service and returning it to the caller.

* SubscribeUseCase - A use case that subscribes a user to the service. The SubscribeUseCase is responsible for subscribing
a user to the service and updating the user's subscription status.

* SendEmailsUseCase - A use case that sends an email to all subscribed users with the current exchange rate. The
SendEmailsUseCase is responsible for getting the current exchange rate from a third-party service and sending an email
to all subscribed users with the current exchange rate.

These entities, objects, and other concepts are used to implement the business logic of the application. They are also
used to provide a consistent and well-defined interface for interacting with the application.

In DDD, entities are objects that represent real-world objects. They have a unique identity and can be stored in a
database. Objects are non-persistent objects that represent real-world objects. They do not have a unique identity and
cannot be stored in a database. Value objects are non-persistent objects that represent values. They do not have a
unique identity and cannot be stored in a database. Aggregate roots are entities that own a collection of other
entities. The aggregate root is responsible for managing the lifecycle of its child entities. Repositories are objects
that provide access to a collection of entities. Repositories are responsible for storing, retrieving, and updating
entities. Use cases are units of functionality that provide a specific business outcome. Use cases are responsible for
coordinating the interaction between entities and repositories.
